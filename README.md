## Optional Dependencies

Typer uses <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Click</a> internally. That's the only dependency.

But you can also install extras:

* <a href="https://pypi.org/project/colorama/" class="external-link" target="_blank"><code>colorama</code></a>: and Click will automatically use it to make sure your terminal's colors always work correctly, even in Windows.
    * Then you can use any tool you want to output your terminal's colors in all the systems, including the integrated `typer.style()` and `typer.secho()` (provided by Click).
    * Or any other tool, e.g. <a href="https://pypi.org/project/wasabi/" class="external-link" target="_blank"><code>wasabi</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/erikrose/blessings" class="external-link" target="_blank"><code>blessings</code></a>.
* <a href="https://github.com/click-contrib/click-completion" class="external-link" target="_blank"><code>click-completion</code></a>: and Typer will automatically configure it to provide completion for all the shells, including installation commands.

You can install `typer` with `colorama` and `click-completion` with `pip install typer[all]`.
